Memory Game:
  - Start game button that triggers an initialization function (OK) to set the game as follows:
    * shuffles an array of cards of a fixed size.
    * displays the cards for 3 seconds then flips them.
  - When the player clicks a card, it flips. The value of the clicked card is stored in a variable,
  then the event listener wait for a second card to be clicked and stored to call a comparison function.
  - The comparison function will check if the two cards are identical:
    * if they are, the cards will become un-clickable, and their values will be stored in a match array.
    * if they are not, the cards will flip back.
  - After every comparison, the winning function will be called:
    * it checks if all the slots in the match array are taken, if they are, it's a win, else the game continues.
    * if winner is true, a message is rendered to the user and a restart button is displayed.
  - The restart button calls the init function again and clears the arrays.
